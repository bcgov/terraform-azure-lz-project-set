# terraform-azure-lz-project-set

This Terraform module is designed to provision and manage a set of Azure landing zones (subscriptions) tailored for different environments such as development, testing, production, and tools.

For each environment, the module will create a subscription, a network resource group, and a virtual network. Each virtual network is connected to a central virtual WAN hub, enhancing connectivity across the Azure landing zone.
